Goal: Write a SFML program that reads in shapes from a config file and draws 
those shapes to the screen. The shapes will also include an initial velocity.

These shapes will 'bounce' off the edges of the screen.

Initial Position (X, Y)   float, float
Initial Velocity (Vx, Vy) float, float
RGB Color                 int, int, int
Size (Wdith, Height)      float, float
